## Abstract

Lake Tana, the largest lake in Ethiopia and the source of the Blue Nile River, faces significant water quality challenges due to anthropogenic activities and climate variability. This research employed MODIS satellite imagery from 2008 to 2018 to analyze spatial and temporal variations of water quality parameters. The study developed empirical regression models for estimating turbidity, chlorophyll-a, and suspended solids concentrations based on satellite reflectance data.

Key methodological components included:
1. MODIS data processing and temporal compositing
2. Development of empirical water quality models
3. Mann-Kendall trend analysis for decadal assessment
4. Spatial statistics for heterogeneity analysis
5. Seasonal comparison (August 2016, December 2016, March 2017)

Results revealed significant spatial heterogeneity in water quality across Lake Tana, with higher turbidity observed in northern regions. Temporal analysis showed a decreasing trend in turbidity over the 11-year study period. Seasonal patterns indicated highest turbidity during the wet season (August) and lowest during the dry season (March).

The research demonstrates the effectiveness of remote sensing for water quality monitoring in large inland water bodies and provides valuable insights for sustainable management of Lake Tana. The developed methodology can be applied to other Ethiopian lakes and contributes to the field of water resources engineering through innovative application of satellite technology.
