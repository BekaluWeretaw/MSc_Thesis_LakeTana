## 📖 Abstract
This research utilizes MODIS satellite imagery to analyze spatial and temporal variations of water quality parameters in Lake Tana, Ethiopia. The study covers an 11-year period (2008-2018) and includes detailed seasonal analysis for August 2016, December 2016, and March 2017. Using Google Earth Engine, the research implements empirical regression models for water quality parameter estimation and conducts trend analysis.

## 🎯 Research Objectives
1. Analyze spatial variation of water quality parameters in Lake Tana
2. Assess temporal variation from 2008 to 2018
3. Develop empirical models for water quality estimation
4. Conduct trend analysis using statistical methods
5. Provide recommendations for lake management
